# Project: HoriSEOn SEO Refactor

## Description

This purpose of this project is to **refactor HoriSEOn's corporate home page** to be more accessible and to improve the code to bring it up to current industry standards best known practices.

**Accessibility** is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is crucial for businesses to implement&mdash; not only do accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google, but they also help companies avoid litigation which might arise if people with disabilities cannot access a website. Plus, it ensures that **all** users can access the company's products and services; thus broadening their customer base.

I loved implementing this project for HoriSEOn. The code has been brought up to date to current HTML 5 semantic standards, and the CSS modified and commented appropriately. I removed several CSS redundancies, therefore shortening and simplifying the styles.css file, and shortening the resulting page load time for both files. (Probably not by a lot...but still!)

The finished code accomplishes the client's objectives and will ensure HoriSEOn is up to current standards and ranks higher in prominent search engines.
